# Hotjar

## About the Project
This is our very first collaborative project which we are doing as a part of our curriculum at MASAI.
We have developed the working clone of the websie Hotjar https://www.hotjar.com/ .
Hotjar is a powerful tool that reveals the online behavior and voice of users by combining both Analysis and Feedback tools.
The aim was to clone a minimum of 6 pages within 9 days.
